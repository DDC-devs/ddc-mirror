-- Types of Expressions -------------------------------------------------------
-- See if we can print out any type.
:check add

-- Instantiate the outer forall of the type of add with a region handle.
-- Region handles in the expression are automatically added to the store at
-- startup time.
:check add {R1#}

-- Instantiate all the foralls with different region handles.
:check add {R1#} {R2#} {R3#}

-- Same as above, but with nicer syntax.
:check add {:R1# R2# R3#:}

-- Instantiate all the foralls with the same region handle.
-- The 'add' primop causes the effect (Read R1# + Read R1#) which should be 
-- packed down to just (Read R1#).
:check add {:R1# R1# R1#:}

-- Wrap type lambdas around the 'add' primop and use these to rename the 
-- anonymous binders in its type.
:check \(r1 r2 r3:%).add {:r1 r2 r3:}
