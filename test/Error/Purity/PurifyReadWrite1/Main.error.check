    Cannot purify Read effect on Mutable region.
      A purity constraint on a Read effect requires the region it
      acts on to be Const, and it cannot be Mutable at the same time.

              the use of: succ
             with effect: Base.!Read %87
                      at: ./test/Error/Purity/PurifyReadWrite1/Main.ds:9:18

        is being purified by
              the use of: suspend1
                      at: ./test/Error/Purity/PurifyReadWrite1/Main.ds:9:23

        which conflicts with
              constraint: Base.Mutable %68
         from the use of: (:=)
