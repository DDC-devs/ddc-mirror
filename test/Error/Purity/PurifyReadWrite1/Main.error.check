    Cannot purify Read effect on Mutable region.
      A purity constraint on a Read effect requires the region it
      acts on to be Const, and it cannot be Mutable at the same time.

              the use of: (+)
             with effect: Base.!Read %26
                      at: ./test/Error/Purity/PurifyReadWrite1/Main.ds:6:19

        is being purified by
              the use of: suspend2
                      at: ./test/Error/Purity/PurifyReadWrite1/Main.ds:6:21

        which conflicts with
              constraint: Base.Mutable %26
         from the use of: (:=)
