    Cannot purify Read effect on Mutable region.
      A purity constraint on a Read effect requires the region it
      acts on to be Const, and it cannot be Mutable at the same time.

              the use of: (*)
             with effect: Base.!Read %153
                      at: ./test/Error/Purity/PurifyReadWrite2/Main.ds:5:25

        is being purified by
              the use of: mapL
                      at: ./test/Error/Purity/PurifyReadWrite2/Main.ds:5:18

        which conflicts with
              constraint: Base.Mutable %57
         from the use of: (:=)
