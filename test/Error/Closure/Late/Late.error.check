    The type inference algorithm made an incorrect assumption
        about the mutability of `box'.
                   (and backtracking isn't implemented yet).

        scheme we've been using:
            box
              :: forall tTS3
              .  Main.Box %139 (Data.List.List %144 tTS3)

        scheme we should have used:
            box
              :: Main.Box %139 (Data.List.List %144 @145)
              :- Base.Mutable %139

    Please add a type signature for `box' which provides
        the mutability constraints present in the second scheme.
