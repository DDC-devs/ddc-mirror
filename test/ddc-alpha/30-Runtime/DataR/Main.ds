-- Had a bug (not recorded in the bug tracker) in the LLVM backend where the
-- size field of a DataR object was not set correctly. This was find until
-- the garbage collector was run. The garbage collector would find an object
-- with size zero and crash.
--
-- With this test we try to trigger this bug much earlier by allocating a
-- single FlatString and then running the collector. If the collector finds
-- a problem it will abort the program.
