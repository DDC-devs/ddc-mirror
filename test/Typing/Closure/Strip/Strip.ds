-- Checks basic closure typing.
--	addX1 has a free variable, which it's reading.
--
-- 	If closure typing isn't working then the scheme 
--	for add1X' will have lost its effect info,
--	along with the info about the free variable x.

-- add1X reads a region from a free variable.
--
x 		= 5;
add1X ()	= x + 1;


-- identity, but force f to be a function.
--
idF f	= case True of {
		True	-> f;
		False	
		 -> \x -> error "argh";
	};
	

--
add1X'	= idF add1X;
