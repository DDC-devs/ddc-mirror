-- makeGetGet
--	This example is similar to the GetSet soundness example, with [] being
--	shared by two functions and being instantiated at different types.
--	
--	However, as the box is not updated (and hence, not Mutable)
--	there are no dangerous type vars and this does not result in a type error.

makeGetGet x
 = do {	box 	= Just x;
 	get ()	= case box of { Just z -> z; };
	(get, get); };

checkGetGet ()
 = do {	box2	= makeGetGet [];

	get1	= snd box2;
	get2	= snd box2;

	a	= "a" : get1 ();
	b	=  1  : get2 (); 

	(a, b);
 };
