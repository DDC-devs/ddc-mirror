./test/15-Typing/Signatures/SmallerClosure/Test.ds:6:8
    Inferred type:
            thing
              :: forall %rDE113 %rDE112
              .  Int32 %rDE113 -> Int32 %rDE112 -($cDE486)> Int32 %rDE113
              :- $cDE486 =  Test.x : %rDE113

    Is smaller than signature:
            thing
              :: forall %rDE111 %rDE112 %rDE113 Test.$c1 Test.%r5
              .  Int32 %rDE111 -> Int32 %rDE112 -($cDE486)> Int32 %rDE113
              :- $cDE486 =  xDE484 : %rDE111
              ,  !c1 =  Test.x : %r5

    Because  %rDE111  does not match  %rDE113
