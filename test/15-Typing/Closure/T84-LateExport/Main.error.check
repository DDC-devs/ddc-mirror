    The type inferencer made an incorrect assumption about the
        mutability of 'ref', (and backtracking isn't implemented).

        we were using this type scheme:
            ref
              :: forall tTS4
              .  Base.Ref %108 (tTS4 -> tTS4)

        but a new
              constraint: Base.Mutable %108
         from the use of: (#=)
                      at: ./test/15-Typing/Closure/T84-LateExport/Main.ds:7:16

        was discovered, which means 'tTS4' was not actually
        safe to generalise.

    Please add a type signature for 'ref' which provides this
        mutability constraint.
