        I naively assumed that 'ref' was constant,
        and thus safe to generalise.
        Recent statements have yielded new constraints,
        alas, I was mistaken.
        
        I was using:
            ref
              :: forall t0
              .  Ref %106 (t0 -> t0)
        
        But then I found the
              constraint: Mutable %106
         from the use of: (#=)
                      at: ./test/15-Typing/Closure/T84-LateExport/Main.ds:7:16
        
        This means that 't0' was not safe to generalise in the first place.
        
        Please add a type signature for 'ref' which provides this mutability
        constraint so I can see it earlier. Sorry.
