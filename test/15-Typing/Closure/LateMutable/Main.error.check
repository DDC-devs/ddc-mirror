        I naively assumed that 'box' was constant,
        and thus safe to generalise.
        Recent statements have yielded new constraints,
        alas, I was mistaken.
        
        I was using:
            box
              :: forall t0
              .  Main.Box %173 (Data.List.List %180 t0)
        
        But then I found the
              constraint: Mutable %173
         from the use of: (#=)
                      at: ./test/15-Typing/Closure/LateMutable/Main.ds:27:16
        
        This means that 't0' was not safe to generalise in the first place.
        
        Please add a type signature for 'box' which provides this mutability
        constraint so I can see it earlier. Sorry.
