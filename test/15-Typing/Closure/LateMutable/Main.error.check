    The type inferencer made an incorrect assumption about the
        mutability of 'box', (and backtracking isn't implemented).

        we were using this type scheme:
            box
              :: forall tTS3
              .  Main.Box %173 (Data.List.List %180 tTS3)

        but a new
              constraint: Mutable %173
         from the use of: (#=)
                      at: ./test/15-Typing/Closure/LateMutable/Main.ds:27:16

        was discovered, which means 'tTS3' was not actually
        safe to generalise.

    Please add a type signature for 'box' which provides this
        mutability constraint.
