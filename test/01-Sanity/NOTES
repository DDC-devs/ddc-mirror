The tests in this directory are for basic sanity testing. 
This is where we compile "Hello World" and see what happens.

All basic functionality and syntax should be covered, and if
anything fundamental is wrong it should be picked up here.

All the tests here should compile and run successfully.
Put tests that are expected to fail somewhere else.
