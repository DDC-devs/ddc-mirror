-- #258: Give a civilised error message that CAFs are not supported.

-- Only lambdas can appear in letrecs anyway.
Error loading module
  When checking expression.
    Letrec can only bind lambda abstractions.
          This is not one: ()
    
    with: letrec {
            five : Unit = ()
          } in
          ()


-- We allow CAFs in the Lite and Salt languages,
-- but we can't convert them to object code yet.
