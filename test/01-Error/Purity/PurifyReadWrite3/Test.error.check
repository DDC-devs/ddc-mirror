    Cannot purify Read effect on Mutable region.
      A purity constraint on a Read effect requires the region it
      acts on to be Const, and it cannot be Mutable at the same time.

              the use of: (+)
             with effect: Base.!Read %72
                      at: ./test/Error/Purity/PurifyReadWrite3/Test.ds:3:21

        is being purified by
              the use of: suspend2
                      at: ./test/Error/Purity/PurifyReadWrite3/Test.ds:3:23

        which conflicts with
              constraint: Base.Mutable %72
         from the use of: (:=)
