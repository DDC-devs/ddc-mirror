-- add is commutative. particular regions so it only runs once (ie terminates)
ok, added add_comm

-- commutativity. doesn't change (weaken) type. only for regions
ok

-- swap the 1 and 2
addInt [R1#] [R0#] [R2#] (2 [R1#] ()) (1 [R0#] ())

-- don't swap because they're all R0.
addInt [R0#] [R0#] [R0#] (1 [R0#] ()) (2 [R0#] ())

-- swap the whole whiz-bang
addInt [R1#] [R0#] [R2#] (3 [R1#] ()) (addInt [R0#] [R0#] [R0#] (1 [R0#] ()) (2 [R0#] ()))

-- don't rewrite if it's not an addInt
mulInt [R0#] [R1#] [R2#] (1 [R0#] ()) (2 [R1#] ())
