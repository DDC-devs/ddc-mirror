ok, added copyConst

copyConst [r1 : %] (x : Int r1) . Const r1 => copyInt [r1] [r1] x = x

-- don't do for any region
letregion r in
(\(x : Int r). ())
    (copyInt [r] [r] (23 [r] ()))

-- do it for consts
letregion r with {w : Const r} in
(\(x : Int r). ())
    (weakeff [Read r + Alloc r] in
     23 [r] ())

-- todo more tests with de bruijns
-- and with witnesses as lambda arguments
