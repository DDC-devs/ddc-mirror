FIXED 2007/4/12.2
*	Push TUnify, TInstLet into Constraint 

2007/4/1.7
* Change TUnify to CUnify
	Have an actual constraint which performs unification of types,
	shift as much of the junk as possible out of Type.Exp


....
FIXED 2007/4/17.1
*	Change backRef List in Type eq Classes to Set.


DITCH 2007/3/29.1
* Let bind all lamba exprs in desugar.
	covert map (\x -> x + 1) xs
	to     do { f = \x -> x + 1;
		    map f xs; }

	Effect masking/constraint cleaning is tied to generalisation. All functions need to be generalised, so 
	make sure they're let bound.

	DITCH:
	This breaks projection functions. If we generalise then no type is forced into x, so things
	like f (\x -> x.v) become ambiguous.
	


FIXED 2007/2/18.1
* The core lanauge is too big, too much stuff in it.
	Need to rationalise this.
	merge XBox, XUnbox, XSuspend, XForce into XPrim?
	merge XCurry, XCall, XCallApp ... 
	
	move XClass to LAM
	ditch SRegions


FIXED 2007/2/26
*	change TRegion to TVar KRegion


FIXED 2007/2/16.2 testcase is Optimise/TailCall/Test1
* Tail calling optimisations tail calls fns in match exprs.

	fun ()
	 = match {
	 	| ... <- fun ()			.. don't tail call here!
		= ...
