# The Disciplined Disciple Compiler

DDC is a research compiler used to investigate program transformation in the
presence of computational effects. It compiles a family of strict functional
core languages and supports region, effect and closure typing. This extra
information provides a handle on the operational behaviour of code that isn't
available in other languages. Programs can be written in either a pure/functional
or effectful/imperative style, and one of our goals is to provide both styles
coherently in the same language.
